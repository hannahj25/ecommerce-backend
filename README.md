## Description
This application simulates the back end of an e-commerce website, allowing user to view a database of categories, products and tags. Functional routes also enable posting new data to the database, updating existing data and deleting data (as tested in Insomnia).

## Installation
First you will need to delete "EXAMPLE" from .envEXAMPLE, and add your MySQL user and password to that file.

Next, in the command line run 

`npm install`

Then you can start the MySQL shell, create the database, seed it, and finally start the server, as demonstrated in this video:
